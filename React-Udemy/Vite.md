**Vite** is a modern [[frontend]] build tool developed by **Evan You** (creator of [[Vue]]). It provides a fast and lightweight development experience by using native **ES modules** in the browser during development, and an optimized bundling process for production.

Vite improves performance over traditional bundlers (like [[Webpack]]) by offering:

- **Instant server start**
    
- **[[Hot Module Replacement (HMR)]]**
    
- **Faster builds**
    
- Out-of-the-box support for [[React]], [[Vue]], and other [[frameworks]]
    

Vite is especially popular in projects that prioritize speed, simplicity, and modern [[tooling]]. It supports [[open-source]] ecosystems and is highly customizable.
