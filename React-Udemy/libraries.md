**Libraries** are collections of reusable code that provide specific functionality, which developers can use as needed. In [[frontend]] development, libraries like [[Lodash]], [[Axios]], or D3 help solve focused problems such as [[data]] manipulation, [[HTTP requests]], or [[data]] visualization.

Unlike [[frameworks]], libraries don’t impose [[structure]] or flow — you call them when needed, giving you more flexibility and control. They are often used to reduce development time, avoid reinventing the wheel, and ensure well-tested, reliable solutions for common tasks.

Choosing the right libraries can help reduce [[complex|complexity]], improve [[maintain|maintainability]], and enhance the capabilities of your [[codebase]] without unnecessary overhead.
