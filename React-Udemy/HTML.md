**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to define the **[[structure]]** and **content** of a [[ιστοσελίδα]]. It describes elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and containers using a system of **tags** (e.g., `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`).

In [[frontend]] development, HTML works alongside [[CSS]] (for styling) and [[JavaScript]] (for interactivity). While HTML defines _what_ is on the page, other technologies define _how_ it looks and behaves.

Modern [[frameworks]] like [[React]] use [[JSX]], which resembles HTML, but allows for dynamic rendering of [[components]] based on [[εφαρμογή]] [[state]] and [[data]].
