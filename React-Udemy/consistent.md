A **consistent** user experience means that the behavior and appearance of an [[application]] remain [[predictable]] and uniform across different interactions and states. In [[frontend]] development, consistency ensures that users can rely on the [[User Interface (UI)]] to behave in expected ways, especially when the underlying [[data]] or [[internal state]] changes.

Consistency builds trust and usability. It often involves maintaining layout stability, design patterns, and [[predictable]] interactions throughout the app.
