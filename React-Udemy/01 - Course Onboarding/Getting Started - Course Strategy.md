# Course Strategy Overview

- **Audience inclusivity:** The instructor designed the curriculum for newcomers who have never written [[React]] before as well as developers seeking advanced practice. Expect a broad pacing curve and reserve judgment until you have experienced multiple sections.
- **Control your learning pace:** Use the platform tools—rewatching, section hopping, playback speed controls, and the Q&A forum—to tailor the experience. Reserve harsh reviews until you've sampled enough content to evaluate it fairly.
- **Strategic consumption:** You do not need to finish every video to learn [[React]]. Later project sections often reinforce earlier fundamentals in new contexts. When time is scarce, prioritize new concepts and skim repetitive practice.
- **Mandatory hands-on coding:** Passive watching yields "exactly zero" skills. Mirror the instructor's work in your own editor (Codesandbox or local tooling such as [[VS Code]] and [[Vite]]/[[Webpack]] projects) to build muscle memory.
- **Delay perfectionism at the start:** In the early sections, focus on making things work rather than obsessing over idiomatic patterns, best practices, or deep internals like the [[Virtual DOM]]. Master the basics first; nuance comes later.
- **Problem-solving workflow:** When issues appear, troubleshoot independently before seeking help. Search the Q&A archive, and if unresolved, post a concise question with a reproducible Codesandbox link.
- **Section checkpoints:** Because concepts build sequentially, do not rush. Pause after each section to review shared code, refresh your personal notes, and create mini practice snippets (see [[snippets]]).
- **Platform parity mindset:** Despite the course being recorded on macOS, every workflow applies equally to Windows and Linux environments. Errors usually stem from project-specific issues, not the operating system.
- **Sustain motivation:** Keep the process fun. If frustration rises, step away and return refreshed—the payoff is seeing your own application come alive.
