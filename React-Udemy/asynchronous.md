**Asynchronous** programming allows certain operations — like fetching [[data]] from an [[APIs|API]] — to run independently of the main execution thread. This is essential in [[frontend]] development to keep the [[User Interface (UI)]] [[responsive]] while waiting for tasks like network requests, timers, or file reading to complete.

In [[JavaScript]], asynchronous behavior is handled using **[[callbacks]]**, **[[promises]]**, and [[async/await]]. Understanding how asynchronous code works is critical for managing [[state]], avoiding [[inconsistencies]], and [[debugging]] timing-related [[bugs]].

[[React]] [[components]] often use `useEffect` [[useEffect]] to handle asynchronous operations like [[data]] fetching.
