**[[Data]] flow** refers to how [[data]] moves through an [[εφαρμογή]]. In [[frontend]] development, especially with [[React]], [[data]] typically flows in a **unidirectional** manner — from parent to child [[components]] via [[props]].

Understanding [[data]] flow is essential for managing [[state]], [[debugging]], and maintaining [[predictable]] UI behavior. When [[data]] flow is clear and [[consistent]], it's easier to trace how changes in [[state]] affect the [[User Interface (UI)]].

More advanced patterns like **[[shared state]]**, **global [[state]]**, and using [[libraries]] like [[Redux]] or [[Context API]] come into play when multiple [[components]] need access to the same [[data]].
