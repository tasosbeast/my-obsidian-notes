**Hooks** are special [[functions]] introduced in [[React]] 16.8 that allow functional [[components]] to use features like [[state]], lifecycle [[methods]], and context — capabilities that were previously only available in class [[components]].

The most commonly used hooks include:

- `useState` – for managing [[state]]
    
- `useEffect` – for handling side effects (e.g., API calls, [[DOM]] events)
    
- `useContext` – for accessing [[shared state]]
    
- `useRef`, `useReducer`, and custom hooks for more advanced patterns
    

Hooks promote [[reusability]] and cleaner, more [[declarative]] code by isolating logic into reusable [[functions]]. They are now the standard for building modern [[React]] [[components]].
