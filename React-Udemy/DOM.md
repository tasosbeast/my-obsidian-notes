The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the [[structure]] of an [[HTML]] or XML page as a tree of [[objects]], where each element (like a `div`, `p`, or `button`) becomes a node in that tree.

In [[frontend]] development, interacting with the DOM allows developers to modify content, styles, or behavior dynamically. In **Vanilla [[JavaScript]]**, this interaction is done manually using [[methods]] like `document.querySelector()` or `element.innerText`.

[[Frameworks]] like [[React]] abstract direct [[DOM manipulation]] using a [[Virtual DOM]], enabling more efficient and [[declarative]] UI updates.
