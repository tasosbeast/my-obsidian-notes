A system is **prone to [[bugs]]** when it is structured or written in a way that makes errors more likely to occur. In [[frontend]] development, this often happens when the code is [[complex]], [[hard to read]], or lacks proper [[state management]] and validation.

Being prone to [[bugs]] usually means that changes in one part of the system can lead to unexpected issues in another. This creates a fragile [[codebase]] that is difficult to [[συντήρηση]] and [[scale]].  
Preventing [[bugs]] requires clear logic, good abstractions, testing, and adherence to best practices in development.
