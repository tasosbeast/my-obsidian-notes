**[[React]]** was created in **2011** by **[[Jordan Walke]]**, a software engineer at Facebook. He developed [[React]] to solve challenges in building dynamic and maintainable user interfaces within Facebook’s [[complex]] [[codebase]].

[[React]] was first deployed in Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and later [[open-source|open-sourced]] in **2013**, gaining rapid adoption due to its component-based architecture, use of the [[Virtual DOM]], and [[declarative]] approach to UI development.

[[React]]’s creation marked a shift in how developers approached [[frontend]] programming, emphasizing [[state]]-driven UI and reusable [[components]].
