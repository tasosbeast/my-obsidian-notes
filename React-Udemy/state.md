**State** represents the current values or condition of a [[components|component]]
or application at a given moment. In [[frontend]] development, especially with [[React]], the state determines what is rendered on the [[User Interface (UI)]].

When the state changes, [[React]] automatically re-renders the affected [[components]] to reflect those changes — ensuring the UI remains in sync with the underlying [[data]].  
State can be **local** (within a single component) or **global** (shared across multiple [[components]]), and managing it effectively is critical for creating [[responsive]], interactive, and [[Συντήρηση|maintainable]] applications.
