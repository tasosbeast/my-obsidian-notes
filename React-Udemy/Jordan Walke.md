**Jordan Walke** is a software engineer best known as the **creator of [[React]]**, the popular [[JavaScript]] [[libraries|library]] for building user interfaces. While working at Facebook in **2011**, he developed [[React]] to address issues related to [[complex]] UI rendering and [[state]] management.

His work introduced core concepts like the [[Virtual DOM]] and [[components|component-based]] architecture, which have since become foundational in modern [[frontend]] development. [[React]] was later open-sourced in 2013 and quickly became one of the most widely used tools in the web development ecosystem.

Jordanâ€™s contribution helped shift the industry toward more [[declarative]], [[reactive]] UI design patterns.
