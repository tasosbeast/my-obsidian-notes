**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the **presentation** and **layout** of content defined in [[HTML]]. It allows developers to style [[ιστοσελίδα|webpages]] by applying rules for color, spacing, typography, alignment, animations, and more.

CSS separates content from design, improving [[συντήρηση|maintainability]] and enabling reusable styling across elements or [[components]]. It uses **selectors** to target elements and apply **styles** based on rules and specificity.

In modern [[frontend]] development, CSS is often modularized through tools like **CSS Modules**, **Styled [[Components]]**, or utility-first [[frameworks]] like **[[Tailwind CSS]]**, especially in projects using [[React]] or other [[components|component-based]] architectures.
