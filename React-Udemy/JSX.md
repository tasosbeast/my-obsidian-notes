**JSX** ([[JavaScript]] XML) is a syntax extension used in [[React]] that allows developers to write [[HTML]]-like code within [[JavaScript]]. It makes the [[structure]] of the [[User Interface (UI)]] more readable and [[declarative]], closely resembling the final output in the browser.

JSX simplifies the creation of [[components]] by combining markup and logic in a single place. Instead of manually manipulating the [[DOM]], you describe what the UI should look like, and [[React]] handles rendering and updates through the [[Virtual DOM]].

JSX is not required in [[React]], but it's widely used because it improves [[readability]], developer experience, and aligns well with [[components|component-based]] design.
