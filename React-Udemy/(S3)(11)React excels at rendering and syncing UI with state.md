**[[React]]** is especially well-suited for two core responsibilities in [[frontend]] development:

1. **Rendering [[components]]** on a [[webpage]] based on their current [[state]] and [[props]] â€” allowing dynamic, [[components|component-based]] UIs.
    
2. **Keeping the [[User Interface (UI)]] in sync** with [[state]] by automatically re-rendering [[components]] when the [[state]] changes.
    

This [[reactive]] approach eliminates the need for manual [[DOM manipulation]], leading to a more [[predictable]], [[maintain|maintainable]], and efficient UI development process.
