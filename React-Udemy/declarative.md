**Declarative** programming is a paradigm where you describe **what** the program should accomplish, rather than detailing **how** to achieve it step by step (as in [[imperative]] programming). In [[frontend]] development, **[[React]]** embraces a declarative approach to building UIs.

For example, with [[JSX]], you define the desired [[structure]] of the [[User Interface (UI)]], and [[React]] takes care of updating the [[DOM]] to match the current [[state]] or [[data]].

Declarative code tends to be more [[readability|readable]], [[predictable]], and less prone to [[bugs]] than [[imperative]] code, especially in [[complex]] UIs, because it abstracts away the manual steps of UI updates.
