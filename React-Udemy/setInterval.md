The **`setInterval`** [[functions|function]] in **[[JavaScript]]** is used to **repeatedly execute a function** after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It’s commonly used for tasks that need to happen periodically, such as timers, polling, or animations.

Basic syntax:

```js
setInterval(function() {
  // code to run every interval
}, 1000); // runs every 1000ms (1 second)
```

In this example, the function is executed **every 1 second**. The interval continues until it’s cleared using `clearInterval`.

`setInterval` is part of the **browser's [[Web API]]**, and is [[asynchronous]] — the main thread keeps running while the function is scheduled separately.
