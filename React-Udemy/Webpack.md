**Webpack** is a powerful **module bundler** for [[JavaScript]] applications. It takes in various assets — like [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]], images, and more — and bundles them into optimized files for deployment. Webpack plays a key role in modern [[frontend]] development workflows by transforming, optimizing, and managing dependencies.

Key features include:

- **Module bundling**
    
- **Code splitting**
    
- **Loaders** for handling different file types (e.g., Babel, Sass)
    
- **Plugins** for extensibility
    
- **[[Hot Module Replacement (HMR)]]** for fast development
    

Although newer tools like [[Vite]] offer faster dev experiences, Webpack remains widely used in large-[[scale]] projects due to its deep configurability and large ecosystem.
