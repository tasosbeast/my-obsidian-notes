**Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** is a development feature that allows updated modules (files) to be **swapped into a running [[εφαρμογή]]** without requiring a full page reload. It significantly improves the developer experience by preserving the [[εφαρμογή]]’s [[state]] during updates and speeding up feedback loops.

HMR is commonly used in modern [[frontend]] [[tooling]] such as [[Vite]], [[Webpack]], and others. In a [[React]] development environment, HMR lets you see UI or logic changes instantly without losing [[components|component]] [[state]] — making [[debugging]] and iteration much faster.

This feature is particularly useful in [[components|component-based]] development, where small visual or behavioral tweaks are frequent.
