**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing [[bugs]] or unintended behavior in a program. In [[frontend]] development, debugging often involves tools like **browser developer tools**, `console.log`, [[React]] DevTools, and breakpoints.

Effective debugging requires a good understanding of the code’s [[data flow]], [[state]], and how the [[User Interface (UI)]] responds to changes. Clear and [[predictable]] code (such as that written in a [[declarative]] style) is generally easier to debug than [[complex]] or [[imperative]] code.

Good debugging practices improve [[Συντήρηση|maintainability]] and reduce the time needed to resolve issues.
