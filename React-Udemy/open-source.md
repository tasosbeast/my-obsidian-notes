**Open-source** refers to software whose source code is publicly available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. In [[frontend]] development, many key tools and [[frameworks]] — like [[React]], [[Vue]], and [[Vite]] — are open-source.

Open-source projects encourage community collaboration, faster innovation, and transparency. They often grow rapidly due to contributions from developers around the world, and they offer learning opportunities by exposing real-world codebases.

[[React]], for example, was created at Facebook but open-sourced in **2013**, which helped it become one of the most widely used UI [[libraries]] in the world.
