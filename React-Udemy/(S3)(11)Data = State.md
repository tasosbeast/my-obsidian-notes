In modern [[frontend]] development — especially with [[libraries]] like [[React]] — **[[data]] and [[state]] are conceptually equivalent**. Both represent the current condition of the [[application]] and drive what the [[User Interface (UI)]] displays.

In this model, **[[state]] is just [[data]] that changes over time**, typically in response to user interaction or external inputs. Maintaining this [[state]] accurately ensures the UI remains [[predictable]], [[consistent]], and [[responsive]].

This principle underpins the idea of **[[reactive]] rendering**, where UI updates are a direct consequence of changes in [[data]]/[[state]] — eliminating the need for manual [[DOM manipulation]].
