An **application** is a complete and functional software system designed to perform specific tasks for users. In [[frontend]] development, the term usually refers to a **web application** â€” a browser-based program built using technologies like [[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[JavaScript]], and [[frameworks]] such as [[React]].

A [[frontend]] application typically consists of:

- A structured [[User Interface (UI)]]
    
- Internal [[state]] management
    
- [[Data fetching]] from external sources (e.g., [[APIs]])
    
- Routing, forms, interactivity, and real-time updates
    

Modern web applications can be **[[Single Page Application|Single Page Applications]] (SPAs)**, where routing and rendering are handled on the client side, providing a fast, seamless experience without full page reloads.
