**React** is a popular [[JavaScript]] library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React uses a [[components|component-based]] architecture and a [[declarative]] syntax to make UI development more efficient and scalable.

At its core, React manages the [[application]]'s [[state]] and ensures the [[User Interface (UI)]] stays in sync with the underlying [[data]]. It uses a [[Virtual DOM]] to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page.

React encourages [[modularity]], [[reusability]], and clarity by breaking UIs into small, focused [[components]]. It also supports features like [[JSX]], [[props]], [[hooks]], and context for more advanced [[state management]] and behavior.
