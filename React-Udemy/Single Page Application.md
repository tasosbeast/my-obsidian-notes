A **Single Page [[εφαρμογή]] (SPA)** is a type of web [[εφαρμογή]] that loads a single [[HTML]] page and dynamically updates the content based on user interaction — **without reloading the entire page**. This results in a smoother, faster user experience.

SPAs rely heavily on [[JavaScript]] to handle routing, rendering, and communication with [[APIs]]. [[Frameworks]] like [[React]], [[Vue]], and [[Angular]] are commonly used to build SPAs.

Key characteristics:

- **Client-side routing**
    
- Dynamic [[components|component]] rendering
    
- [[Data fetching]] and [[state]] updates without full page reloads
    
- Improved performance after initial load, but often requires proper [[SEO]] handling and code splitting
    

SPAs offer a [[responsive]], app-like feel, ideal for interactive, modern web experiences.
