**Frameworks** are pre-structured tools or [[libraries]] that provide a foundation for building applications. In [[frontend]] development, frameworks like [[React]], [[Vue]], or [[Svelte]] offer conventions, abstractions, and features that simplify tasks such as [[state management]], routing, rendering, and component composition.

Frameworks help reduce [[complex|complexity]] in [[large projects]] by promoting [[modularity]], [[reusability]], and consistency across the [[codebase]]. They often come with integrated [[tooling]] and best practices that improve developer productivity and long-term [[συντήρηση|maintainability]].

While they introduce some learning overhead, frameworks are essential for building scalable, efficient, and maintainable modern web applications.
