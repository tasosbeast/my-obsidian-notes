**Functions** are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In [[JavaScript]] and [[frontend]] development, functions are used to encapsulate logic, handle events, manipulate [[data]], and define behavior in both procedural and component-based code.

Functions improve [[readability]], [[reusability]], and help organize code into manageable units. In [[React]], functional [[components]] are built using functions, and [[hooks]] (like `useState`, `useEffect`) [[useState]] [[useEffect]] are themselves functions that add dynamic behavior.

Functions can be **pure** (no side effects) or **impure**, and understanding this distinction is key to writing [[predictable]] and testable code.
