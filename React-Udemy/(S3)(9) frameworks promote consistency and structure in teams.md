**[[Frameworks]]** provide a more organized and [[consistent]] way of building projects. In team environments, they ensure that all members follow shared practices and a unified logic. This alignment reduces confusion, improves collaboration, and helps [[maintain]] a coherent [[codebase]] over time.

By enforcing patterns and conventions, [[frameworks]] minimize discrepancies between individual coding styles and make the development process more [[predictable]] and [[maintain|maintainable]].
