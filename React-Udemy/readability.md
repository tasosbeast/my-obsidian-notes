**Readability** refers to how easily a developer can understand a piece of code. In [[frontend]] development — and programming in general — high readability makes code easier to debug, modify, and [[maintain]].

Readable code uses clear naming conventions, [[consistent]] formatting, logical [[structure]], and avoids unnecessary [[complex|complexity]]. It often includes meaningful comments and avoids deeply nested logic or cryptic shortcuts.

Improving readability leads to better collaboration, fewer [[bugs]], and a more approachable [[codebase]] — especially important in [[large projects]] with multiple contributors.
