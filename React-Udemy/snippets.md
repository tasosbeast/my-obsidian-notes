**Snippets** are short, reusable pieces of code that can be inserted automatically into your [[Code Editor|editor]] to speed up development. In [[VS Code]], snippets can be customized per language and triggered using shorthand keys.

In the context of [[React]] development, common snippets include:

- `cl` → expands to `console.log()`
    
- `rfc` → creates a [[React]] Functional Component
    
- `forwardRef` → sets up a [[React]] component using `forwardRef`
    

These snippets are usually added via the **User Snippets** setting in VS Code:

1. Open Command Palette → "Preferences: Configure User Snippets"
    
2. Choose or create a snippet file (e.g., `javascript.json`)
    
3. Paste in the predefined snippet code
    

Snippets improve speed, reduce typing, and help [[Συντήρηση]] [[consistent|consistent]] [[structure]] and syntax in projects.
