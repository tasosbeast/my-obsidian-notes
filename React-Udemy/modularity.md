**Modularity** is the design principle of breaking a system into small, self-contained, and reusable units (modules). In [[frontend]] development, modularity allows you to divide your [[codebase]] into [[components]] or files that each handle a specific responsibility.

Modular code is easier to [[maintain]], test, and [[scale]] because changes in one module donâ€™t ripple unpredictably across the entire system. Modularity supports better [[structure]], improves collaboration in teams, and reduces the chance of becoming [[prone to bugs]].

[[Frameworks]] like [[React]] promote modularity through component-based architecture.
