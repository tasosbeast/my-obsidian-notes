**[[State]] management** refers to how an application handles, updates, and shares its internal [[state]] across different parts of the system. In [[frontend]] development — especially with [[frameworks]] like [[React]] — [[state]] management is essential for keeping the [[User Interface (UI)]] in sync with the underlying [[data]].

In small [[components]], local [[state]] (e.g., via `useState`) may be enough. In larger applications, more advanced solutions like **Context API**, **Redux**, or **Zustand** are used to manage shared or global [[state]] in a [[predictable]] and scalable way.

Effective [[state]] management improves [[consistent|consistency]], reduces [[bugs]], and makes the [[codebase]] easier to [[συντήρηση]].
