A **predictable** system behaves in expected and [[consistent]] ways. In [[frontend]] development, predictability means that when the [[state]] or [[data]] changes, the resulting behavior of the [[User Interface (UI)]] can be anticipated with confidence.

Predictable code is easier to debug, test, and [[Συντήρηση]]. [[Frameworks]] like [[React]] promote predictability through clear [[components|component]] structures, [[reactive]] updates, and unidirectional [[data flow]].

When systems are not predictable, developers face challenges like unexpected side effects, [[inconsistencies]], and harder-to-track [[bugs]].
