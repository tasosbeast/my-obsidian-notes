**Bugs** are unintended errors or flaws in a program's logic or behavior. In [[frontend]] development, bugs can appear as broken layouts, incorrect [[data]] display, unresponsive UI elements, or unexpected interactions.

Bugs often result from issues like [[inconsistencies]], poor [[state management]], incorrect [[data flow]], or improper handling of [[asynchronous]] operations. They are more likely to occur in [[complex]] or [[hard to read]] codebases that lack [[structure]] or clear logic.

Preventing and fixing bugs requires good development practices, including testing, clear [[components|component]] design, and avoiding unnecessary [[DOM manipulation]].
