**Imperative** programming is a paradigm where you explicitly define **how** something should be done, step by step. In [[frontend]] development, this often involves direct [[DOM manipulation]] using [[methods]] like `document.querySelector`, `innerText`, or `addEventListener`.

Imperative code gives the developer full control over the logic and flow but can become verbose, [[hard to read]], and [[prone to bugs]] â€” especially in [[large projects]].

In contrast, [[React]] encourages a [[declarative]] style, where you describe **what** the UI should look like based on the current [[state]], and [[React]] handles the rendering logic internally.
