**Reactive** refers to a programming paradigm where changes in [[state]] or [[data]] automatically trigger updates in the [[User Interface (UI)]]. In a reactive system, the UI responds dynamically to [[state]] changes without the need for manual [[DOM manipulation]].

In [[React]], reactivity is achieved through tools like `useState`, `useEffect` [[useState]][[useEffect]], and the component lifecycle. When [[data]] changes, [[React]] re-renders the necessary [[components]] using the [[Virtual DOM]] to reflect the new [[state]] in the UI.

Reactive programming leads to more [[predictable|predictable]] and [[maintain|maintainable]] applications by reducing the need for [[imperative]] update logic.
