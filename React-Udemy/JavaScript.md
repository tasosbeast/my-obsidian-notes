**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive content on [[ιστοσελίδα|webpages]]. Alongside [[HTML]] and [[CSS]], it forms the core trio of technologies in [[frontend]] development.

JavaScript enables:

- Dynamic [[DOM manipulation]]
    
- Event handling (e.g., user interactions)
    
- Fetching [[data]] from [[APIs]]
    
- Logic for animations, form validation, and more
    

Modern JavaScript supports features like **ES6+ syntax** (e.g., [[arrow functions]], modules, [[promises]]), **[[asynchronous]]** programming ([[async/await]]), and **object-oriented** and **functional** paradigms.

It's also the foundation for [[libraries]] and [[frameworks]] like [[React]], [[Vue]], and [[Node.js]] on the [[backend]].
