The **Virtual [[DOM]]** is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual [[DOM]]. In [[React]], the Virtual [[DOM]] is used to optimize performance by minimizing direct [[DOM manipulation]].

When the [[state]] or [[props]] of a component change, [[React]] first updates the Virtual [[DOM]]. It then performs a **diffing** algorithm to compare the new Virtual [[DOM]] with the previous version, identifying the minimal set of changes needed. Finally, [[React]] applies those changes to the real [[DOM]] efficiently.

This approach enables [[declarative]] UI development and improves speed, especially in [[complex]] UIs, by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
