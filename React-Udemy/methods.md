**Methods** are [[functions]] associated with [[objects]] or [[components]] that define specific behaviors or actions. In [[frontend]] development, methods are used to interact with elements, handle events, manipulate [[data]], or trigger UI updates.

In **Vanilla [[JavaScript]]**, methods like `addEventListener`, `querySelector`, or `classList.add` are used to manipulate the [[DOM]]. In [[React]], methods (often defined inside [[components]]) handle logic such as responding to user input or updating [[state]].

Clear and well-structured methods improve code [[readability]] and make [[components]] easier to [[maintain]] and reuse.
