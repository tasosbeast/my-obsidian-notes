**Shared [[state]]** refers to a piece of [[state]] that is accessed and potentially modified by multiple [[components]] in a [[frontend]] application. Unlike **local [[state]]**, which is confined to a single component, shared [[state]] must be lifted to a common ancestor or managed through external tools.

In [[React]], shared [[state]] is commonly handled using the **Context API**, or external [[state]] management [[libraries]] like [[Redux]] or [[Zustand]]. Managing shared [[state]] properly ensures that all relevant [[components]] stay in sync with the same [[data]], avoiding [[inconsistencies]] and redundant logic.

Poorly managed shared [[state]] can lead to [[bugs]], tight coupling between [[components]], and difficulty in [[debugging]].
