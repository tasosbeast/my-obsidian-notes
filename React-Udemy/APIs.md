**APIs** ([[Application]] Programming Interfaces) are structured interfaces that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. In [[frontend]] development, APIs are commonly used to fetch or send [[data]] between the client (e.g., a [[React]] app) and a server or external service.

APIs enable dynamic behavior by providing access to live [[data]], authentication systems, third-party features, and more. Most modern [[frontend]] apps interact with APIs using HTTP [[methods]] like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, often via tools like `fetch` or [[libraries]] like `Axios`. [[Axios]]

Proper handling of APIs is essential for [[state management]], user experience, and maintaining a [[responsive]] and [[consistent]] [[User Interface (UI)]].
