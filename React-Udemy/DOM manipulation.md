**[[DOM]] manipulation** refers to the process of directly accessing and modifying the [[DOM]] (Document Object Model) using [[JavaScript]]. In **Vanilla [[JavaScript]]**, this often involves [[methods]] like `document.querySelector`, `innerHTML`, or `appendChild` to change content, styles, or [[structure]] on the page.

While direct [[DOM]] manipulation gives full control, it becomes error-prone and hard to [[συντήρηση]] in [[large projects]]. It also increases the risk of [[inconsistencies]] between the [[User Interface (UI)]] and the underlying [[data]].

Modern [[frameworks]] like [[React]] abstract away direct [[DOM]] manipulation using a [[Virtual DOM]], enabling a more [[declarative]] and efficient approach to UI updates.
