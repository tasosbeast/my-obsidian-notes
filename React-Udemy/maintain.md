To **maintain** a [[codebase]] means to keep it functional, clean, and adaptable over time. In [[frontend]] development, maintainability refers to how easily developers can understand, update, fix, or extend the code without introducing new [[bugs]].

Maintainable code is often [[modularity|modular]], [[readability|readable]], and well-structured. As [[large projects]] evolve, maintainability becomes critical for ensuring long-term success, especially when multiple developers contribute or when requirements change.

Good maintenance practices include refactoring, writing tests, updating dependencies, and documenting important decisions.
