**Utility-first [[CSS]]** is a styling approach where you build user interfaces by composing **small, single-purpose classes** directly in your markup. Each class typically applies a single style rule (e.g., `mt-4`, `text-lg`, `bg-gray-100`), allowing for rapid development without writing custom [[CSS]].

This approach is central to [[frameworks]] like [[Tailwind CSS]], and contrasts with traditional [[CSS]] methodologies that use semantic class names and separate style definitions.

Utility-first [[CSS]] promotes:

- **Speed** of development
    
- **[[consistent|Consistency]]** across [[components]]
    
- Minimal context-switching between markup and styles
    
- Easier [[maintain|maintainability]] in [[components|component-based]] systems like [[React]]
    

Critics argue it can lead to cluttered [[HTML]], but proponents value its productivity and design system alignment.
