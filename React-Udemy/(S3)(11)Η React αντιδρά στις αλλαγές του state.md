In [[React]], when the [[state]] (i.e., the current [[data]]) of a [[components|component]] changes, [[React]] **automatically re-renders** that component to reflect the new [[state]] in the [[User Interface (UI)]]. This behavior is part of [[React]]’s [[reactive]] architecture.

[[React]]'s rendering is optimized through the [[Virtual DOM]], ensuring only the necessary parts of the [[DOM]] are updated. This process helps [[Συντήρηση]] a [[predictable]] and [[consistent]] UI without manual intervention.

This principle is core to building dynamic interfaces in [[React]] — changes in [[state]] lead directly to changes in what the user sees.
